# Experiment Design: TRNG, EEG, and Machine Learning

This document outlines a structured approach for conducting an experiment to explore whether and how human intention and mental states can influence the outputs of True Random Number Generators (TRNGs). Have a look at more research papers on this [https://icrl.org/scholarly-publications/pear-publications/](https://icrl.org/scholarly-publications/pear-publications/) (Peter, thanks for sharing link to many research papers -> [https://petermerry.org/](https://petermerry.org/)). It is not only about exploring TRNGs but also about learning how to use EEG as a research tool, understanding its functionality, and analyzing the data it produces. As a student of a Master’s program in Applied AI [https://www.iu.org/master/applied-artificial-intelligence/](https://www.iu.org/master/applied-artificial-intelligence/), it is particularly important for me to grasp AI concepts and apply them practically in this research. The ultimate aim is to integrate EEG data and TRNG outputs, applying AI to uncover connections and identify the specific states or conditions under which human intention might affect TRNG behavior, making it clear how mind interaction could alter randomness.

Additionally, I am open to incorporating other tools, such as heartbeat monitors or other physiological measurement devices, to complement the research and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the connections between human intention and TRNG outputs.

Because of the complexity of EEG, I would like to start as easy as possible with only timeline and TRNG, focusing first on how to analyze and interpret the TRNG data. Once a foundational understanding is achieved, I plan to gradually add the complexity of EEG and other tools to expand the scope of the research.
