# &#x20;Chapter 4: Data Processing

#### 1.1 Background

* Overview of TRNGs and their importance.
* Introduction to EEG technology and its applications in neuroscience.
* Potential interaction between human brain activity and TRNGs.
* Role of machine learning in analyzing complex datasets.

#### 1.2 Objectives

* To determine whether EEG patterns influence TRNG output.
* To identify specific EEG features that correlate with TRNG deviations.
* To develop machine learning models for detecting and interpreting these correlations.

#### 1.3 Hypothesis

* State the hypothesis: e.g., "Specific mental states, as measured by EEG, can influence the statistical properties of TRNG outputs."
