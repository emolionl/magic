# Chapter 5: Machine Learning Analysis

#### 5.1 Feature Extraction

* EEG Features: Power spectral density, event-related potentials, connectivity metrics.
* TRNG Features: Bit distribution, entropy, temporal patterns.

#### 5.2 Model Design

* Supervised learning: Label data based on experimental conditions.
* Unsupervised learning: Cluster EEG-TRNG relationships.
* Models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial EEG features, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for temporal dependencies.

#### 5.3 Training and Validation

* Train/test split or cross-validation.
* Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score for classification tasks.
